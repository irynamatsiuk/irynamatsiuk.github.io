      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, nice to see you here! First, I’d like to briefly introduce myself.
        My name is Iryna, and for the past 1.5 years, I’ve been really into web
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, that’s not my only interest. I also like birds, simple food,
        barefoot shoes, and hiking. One of my proudest personal achievements is
        a 200 km coastal hike along the Costa Brava in Spain. I loved it so much
        that I actually did it twice!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been living in the Netherlands for almost 10 years now. After about
        four years, I successfully completed the integration certification —
        even though I wasn’t required to. I did it because I felt it was
        important. For the past three years, I’ve been living in Limburg,
        enjoying the beautiful hilly landscape.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>My Learning Path</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="learning-path">
      <p>
        I used to think that developers were from another planet — like acrobats
        at Cirque du Soleil, doing impossible things I could never imagine
        myself doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        That changed when I saw an advertisement for an online course called
        'Introduction to Web Development' by a UK-based project, Code First
        Girls (CFG). At that point, I had already successfully completed their
        'Introduction to Data & SQL' course, so I decided to give this new one a
        try.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Development course mainly covered HTML and CSS. It wasn’t too
        difficult, which gave me the confidence to explore further. So, I joined
        CFG’s 'Introduction to JavaScript' course. That’s where the easy part
        ended. I quickly realized that I needed something more in-depth than a
        basic introductory course — something that went beyond just scratching
        the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing some research, I found that The Odin Project was exactly
        what I was looking for: self-paced, project-based, and with a
        well-structured, comprehensive curriculum. I won’t lie — the journey has
        been full of challenges and frustration, and it still is! But here I am,
        having grown from knowing absolutely nothing about web development to
        someone who’s built some pretty cool projects (like this one ;-). <br />
        You can find more information about the courses I’ve taken
        <a href="./pages/courses/courses.html">here</a>.

        The most effective learning happens through building projects, which is
        why projects are strategically placed throughout the curriculum of The
        Odin Project — the main contributor to my portfolio. <br />
        You can find all my projects from various courses
        <a href="./pages/projects/projects.html">here</a>, or take a look at a
        few highlighted below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="project-name">Homepage</span> - a responsive app with three
        breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Built using pure CSS, without
        any frameworks. <br />

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="project-name">Memory Gif Game</span> - an app that helps to
        train your memory. You need to click on each of 12 gifs, avoiding
        clicking on the same gif more than once. The program fetches 12 gifs and
        after each click it randomly shuffles gifs with Fisher–Yates shuffle
        algorithm. Initial search value is "Simpsons", but you can change it for
        whatever you want. <br />

      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="project-name">Members Only App: 'Friends'</span> - a
        full-stack web application built with Express, PostgreSQL, EJS, and SASS
        for styling and responsiveness.<br />
        For demo purpose you can log in as Rachel Green (username:
        <i>fashionqueen</i> and password: <i>Gr33nPa55</i>), <br />
        create a user for Chandler (username: <i>chandlerBing77</i>, password:
        <i>Ch4nB1ng</i>, first name: <i>Chandler</i>, lastname: <i>Bing</i>) or
        create your own user. Reset DB if needed.
        <br />
        The app is deployed on Render.com and may take 30–60 seconds to load.
        Thanks for your patience! <br />

      <p class="note">
        Most of my projects are focused on building experience in specific
        areas. For example, if a project is centered around learning JavaScript,
        it might not have advanced styling. And vice versa — projects with
        detailed CSS work may not include much JavaScript interaction.
