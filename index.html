      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, nice to see you here. Before we jump into the technical part I'd
        like to briefly introduce myself. My name is Iryna and last year+ I am
        quite a bit into web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course it's not the only interest I have. I also like birds, simple
        food, 'barefoot' shoes, DIY, and hiking. My dream hike is Tour du Mont
        Blanc.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly - yes, I speak Dutch, obviously not as good as native. I have
        an accent and here and there I make grammatical mistakes, but with a bit
        of patience we will understand each other.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>My Learning Path</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="learning-path">
      <p>
        I had always thought that developers are from another planet. Just like
        acrobats at Cirque du Soleil, who do impossible things that I can never
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        This changed when I saw an advertisement for an online course
        "Introduction to Web Development" from an English project CFG. By that
        time I had already successfully completed CFG's course "Introduction to
        Data & SQL", so I decided to give it a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Development course was mostly about html and css, that wasn't
        too difficult, so I dared to explore this field further and joined
        "Introduction to JavaScript" course, again from CFG. This is where the
        easy part ended. I understood that I need something more serious, than
        introductory course, that just scratches the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my research was done, I came to the conclusion that The Odin
        Project is exactly what I need. Self-paced, project based, with a
        comprehensive curriculum. I won't lie I had a lot of struggles and
        frustration in my journey and I still do have a lot! But here I am now
        grown from absolutely zero knowledge in web development to someone who
        has done some cool projects! <br />

        The most effective learning happens while building projects, that is why
        they are strategically placed throughout the curriculum of The Odin
        Project - the main contributor to my portfolio. <br />

      <p class="note">
        Please note, that most of the projects are focused on getting experience
        and knowledge in specific areas. <br />
        For example, if the project is about JavaScript, it doesn't have fancy
        styling and vice versa project with beautiful CSS, doesn't have
        JavaScript interactions.
