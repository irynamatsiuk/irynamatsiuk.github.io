I chose the Full Stack JavaScript path, that maintains a front-end momentum from Foundations by diving into Javascript. After gaining a solid foundation here, next step is a deeper look at front-end design with HTML and CSS before taking JavaScript skills to the server-side with Express and PostgreSQL in NodeJS.",
