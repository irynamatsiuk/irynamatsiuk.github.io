# Project: Binary Search Trees

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript path

### Chapter: "A Bit of Computer Science"

#### Description:

In this project I've written a function that builds a balanced binary search trees (BST).
A BST allows fast operations for lookup, insertion, and deletion of data items.

#### Assignment:

> 1. Build a Node class/factory. It should have an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.
> 2. Build a Tree class/factory which accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class should have a root attribute, which uses the return value of buildTree
> 3. Write a buildTree(array) function that takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed (don’t forget to sort and remove duplicates!). The buildTree function should return the level-0 root node.
> 4. Write **insert(value)** and **deleteItem(value)** functions that insert/delete the given value.
> 5. Write a **find(value)** function that returns the node with the given value.
> 6. Write a **levelOrder()** function that should traverse the tree in breadth-first level order
> 7. Write **inOrder()**, **preOrder()**, and **postOrder()** functions. Each of these functions should traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order
> 8. Write a **height(node)** function that returns the given node’s height. Height is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from a given node to a leaf node.
> 9. Write a **depth(node)** function that returns the given node’s depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in the path from a given node to the tree’s root node.
> 10. Write an **isBalanced** function that checks if the tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of the left subtree and the right subtree of every node is not more than 1.
> 11. Write a **rebalance** function that rebalances an unbalanced tree.
