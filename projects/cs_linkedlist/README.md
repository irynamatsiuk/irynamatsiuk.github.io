# Project: Linked Lists

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript path

### Chapter: "A Bit of Computer Science"

#### Description:

In this project I've learnt about Linked List data structure, which functions similarly to an array. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation of any other elements.
I did't dive deep into the logic of bulding all function in order to avoid all bugs, instead I focused on understanding concepts.  
There is no GUI component to this project, it can be run in the command line using the node command installed with nodejs.

#### Assignment:

> You will need two classes or factories:
>
> 1. LinkedList class / factory, which will represent the full list.
> 2. Node class / factory, containing a value property and a nextNode property, set both as null by default.

> Build the following functions in your linked list class / factory:
>
> 1. **append(value)** adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
> 2. **prepend(value)** adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
> 3. **size** returns the total number of nodes in the list
> 4. **head** returns the first node in the list
> 5. **tail** returns the last node in the list
> 6. **at(index)** returns the node at the given index
> 7. **pop** removes the last element from the list
> 8. **contains(value)** returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
> 9. **find(value)** returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
> 10. **toString** represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

> Extra credit
>
> 1. **insertAt(value, index)** that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
> 2. **removeAt(index)** that removes the node at the given index.
