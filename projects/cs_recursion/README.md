# Project: Recursion

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript path

### Chapter: "A Bit of Computer Science"

#### Assignment:

> 1. Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
> 2. Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
> 3. Test both versions of your functions by passing in various lengths as arguments.

#### Description:

I have written 4 solutions for the problem:

1. simple function, that returns fibonacci sequence, created with 'for' loop
2. complex recursive solution, using 'for' loop and recursion
3. crazy recursive solution, using 2 recursions
4. best recursive solution, using memoization

There is no GUI component to this project, it can be run in the command line using the node command installed with nodejs.
