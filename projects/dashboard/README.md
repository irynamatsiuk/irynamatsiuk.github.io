# Project: Admin Dashboard

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript

### Chapter: "Intermediate HTML and CSS Course"

#### Description:

All the dashboard's layout is created with CSS Grid, also Custom Properties and advanced selectors (the child combinator, pseudo-class and pseudo-element) are used for styling.

It's slightly responsive to screen size changes due to natural responsiveness of grid and flexbox.
