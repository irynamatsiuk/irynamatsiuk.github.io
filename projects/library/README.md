# Project: Library

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript path

### Chapter: "JavaScript, Organizing Your JavaScript Code"

#### Description:

Library's books are objects and stored in an array. User can add new books to the library. Modal dialog is used to let user to input details of a new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it's been read. All books are shown in a table, where user can edit book's status (read / not yet read) or remove a book from the library. All changes in the table make corresponding chages in the array.

This project doesn't have any storage to save the information between page reloads.
