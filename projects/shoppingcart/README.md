#### Assignment:

> 1. Create a new React project.
> 2. Think about how to structure your application into components. You should have at least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let the user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.
> 3. To your homepage, you can add whatever you’d like. It doesn’t have to be something fancy - it’s to test the concepts taught thus far.
> 4. On the shopping cart page, you should have the same navigation bar that displays the number of items currently in the cart.
> 5. Build individual card elements for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
> 6. Fetch your shop items from [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) or something similar.
> 7. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.
