## Course: The Odin Project, Foundations

### Chapter: "JavaScript Basics"

#### Description:

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.
Live version: [Etch-a-Sketch](https://irynamatsiuk.github.io/projects/sketch/sketch.html)

#### Assignment:

> Build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch
>
> - Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
> - Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid, as it will be taught in a later lesson after the foundations path. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!
> - Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
> - Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
>   Extra credit:
> - Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
