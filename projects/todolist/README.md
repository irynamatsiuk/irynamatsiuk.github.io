# Project: To-Do List: 'Get Shit Done.'

## Course: The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript path

### Chapter: "JavaScript, Organizing Your JavaScript Code"

#### Description:

Once the app is open for the first time a user can create a new project or add tasks to existing one. In addition user can load a few predefined demo tasks to any empty project. All tasks can be marked as 'done' or deleted. Template tag is used for generating list items in JS.
Local Storage is added to the project in order to save user's data.

Live version: ['Get Shit Done.'](https://irynamatsiuk.github.io/live/todolist_live/template.html)

#### Assignment:

> Your ‘todos’ are going to be objects that you’ll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.
> Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
> You should separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.
